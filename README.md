# scz_cross-scale_abnormalities

This repository houses the core codes used in the paper "***Neuroimaging and multiomics reveal cross-scale circuit abnormalities in schizophrenia***".

**Notes:**  
* We utilized multiple software applications and packages in the analyses, whilst also incorporating certain third-party data resources. 
Please refer to the "**Code availability**" and "**Data availability**" sections, where comprehensive descriptions regarding these aspects have been provided.

* Some relatively "trivial" codes have not been included in this repository. 
For example, those that can be easily accomplished with very few lines of code or can be directly referenced from other publicly available repositories. 
Nonetheless, the "**Methods**" section of our paper provides a highly detailed description of how each analysis was conducted.
